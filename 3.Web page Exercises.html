<h2>plot</h2>
<p>2002: In Nagercoil, a timid 17-year-old Bhavani witnesses his family's murder by his father's rivals. He is forced to take the blame and is incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility, where he is tortured mercilessly. As a consequence, he develops a ruthless and brash persona. Years later, Bhavani is released from the facility and becomes the owner of the lorry and trade business. Gradually, he becomes a feared gangster and remains immune from punishment by coercing the inmates of the detention facility to take the blame for his crimes. Creating an enormous syndicate for himself, he grows on par with his father's former rivals and eventually kills them.
