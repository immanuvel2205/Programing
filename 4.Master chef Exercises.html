<h2  >Biriyani</h2><hr>
<p><b>Details:</b>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating in South Asia. It is made with Indian spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, and fish), or in some cases without any meat,using Paneer or simply vegetables.[1] and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[2]

    Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[3] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
<br>
<h2>Incredients</h2><hr>
<p>
    Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (of either chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[23] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, kismis and fruits, such as apples and pineapples.[19]

The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[24] pepper, cloves,[24] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[25] and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[24]

The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.

<h2>Preparation styles</h2><hr>
<p>
    Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki ("cooked") and kacchi ("raw")
    <ul>
<li>In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially ("three-quarters") cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric to give the rice different colours and flavours).
 
    The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavours to combine. Alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.</li>
<li>In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated in layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking, or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients' own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam cannot escape (proper dum pukht).
 
    A yoghurt-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot provides additional flavour and moisture. Potatoes often comprise the bottom layer (a technique also used in Iranian cuisine), because, with their natural moisture content, they brown well with less risk of getting burned accidentally. The lid is not opened until the dish is ready to serve. Kacchi biryani is technically much more demanding and time-consuming than pakki biryani, for the following reasons:</li>

<li>One method is cooking the dish "blind", with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor the cooking progressâ€”it takes the understanding of the raw foods used, the heat required to cook those raw foods, and how the climate can affect the cooking process. Hence making kacchi biryani requires a seasoned hand.</li>

<h2>Varieties</h2><hr>
<h3>An Indien subcontinent</h3>
<p id="room"><div>There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India.

    Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[27] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[28][29] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[19] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities. </div></p>
